## About the Book
With the rise in the number of tools and technologies available today, developers and architects are always exploring ways to create better and smarter solutions. Before, the differences between target platforms was a major roadblock, but that's not the case now. .NET Core 2.0 By Example will take you on an exciting journey to building better software.

This book provides fresh and relevant content to .NET Core 2.0 in a succinct format that’s enjoyable to read. It also delivers concepts, along with the implications, design decisions, and potential pitfalls you might face when targeting Linux and Windows systems, in a logical and simple way.

With the .NET framework at its center, the book comprises of five varied projects: a multiplayer Tic-tac-toe game; a real-time chat application, Let'sChat; a chatbot; a microservice-based buying-selling application; and a movie booking application. You will start each chapter with a high-level overview of the content, followed by the above example applications described in detail. By the end of each chapter, you will not only be proficient with the concepts, but you’ll also have created a tangible component in the application.

By the end of the book, you will have built five solid projects using all the tools and support provided by the .NET Core 2.0 framework.
## Instructions and Navigation

For C# and .NET Core Samples:
Open the Packt.DotNetCore2ByExamples.Examples.sln solution file in Visual Studio 2017

For F# Project:
Open the F# sample project solution in Visual Studio 2017 and run the app.

For C++ and Ubuntu code samples:
Ubuntu Code samples should be downloaded and opened with Visual Studio Code.
C++ ExampleDll solution can be directly opened in Visual Studio 2017.

The code will look like the following:
```
